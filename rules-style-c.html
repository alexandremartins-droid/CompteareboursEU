<!-- ARTICLE 8 -->
<div id="art8" class="section-title">Article 8: Game Journey</div>
<div class="article-card">
    <p>
        The Game journey is divided into four progressive phases, each designed to develop participants' knowledge and skills around STELLANTIS connected services:
    </p>

    <p class="article-label">8.1 Educational Phase (THE ACADEMY)</p>
    <p>
        This first fundamental mission takes place in three distinct sessions, each lasting between 10 and 15 minutes.
        It aims to build a solid foundation of knowledge of connected services:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>#1: Discovery of STELLANTIS connected service fundamentals via the Drive Smarter session</li>
        <li>#2: Discovery of STELLANTIS connected service fundamentals via the Easier Life session</li>
        <li>#3: Discovery of STELLANTIS connected service fundamentals via the Enjoyable Trip session</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="article-label">8.2 Practical Phase (THE PRACTICE EXCURSION)</p>
    <p>
        In this second phase, the participant is placed in a simulation of a long-distance logistics journey, presented as an interactive course.
        At different stages of the virtual journey, the participant is confronted with situations requiring decision-making that will determine the participant's subsequent journey.
        For each situation, several response options are offered to the participant.
        No answer is considered incorrect, but some choices may be more efficient than others in terms of time, resources, or journey optimization.
    </p>

    <p class="article-label">8.3 Prospective Brainstorming Phase (THE LABORATORY)</p>
    <p>
        This third phase is a creative test aimed at imagining the connected services of the future.
        The participant is invited to answer an open question about potential innovations in the field of connected logistics services.
        The response must be formulated in text form in the dedicated space, in English, and without character limit.
    </p>
    <p>Each of these three sessions allows participants to accumulate essential points for qualification in the final phase, while consolidating their expertise and knowledge.</p>

    <p class="article-label">8.4 Finale (THE BIG FINALE)</p>
    <p>
        The grand finale consists of creating original content showcasing and highlighting one or more connected services,
        from an internal communication perspective.
        Finalists can submit their creation in one of the following formats:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Video content (maximum duration: 2 minutes)</li>
        <li>Audio content (maximum duration: 3 minutes)</li>
        <li>Detailed scenario (Word, PDF)</li>
        <li>Visual or infographic (accepted formats: JPG, PNG, PDF)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the development of their creation, finalists shall exclusively use STLA Artificial Intelligence tools.</p>
    <p>
        Only employees who have obtained the highest number of points at the end of the five weekly challenges are qualified to participate in the grand finale,
        with the following regional distribution:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Top 200 in Europe</li>
        <li>Top 100 in North America</li>
        <li>Top 35 in South America</li>
        <li>Top 35 in the IAP/China area</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        At the end of the creation period, all challenge participants, irrespective of whether they participated in the Grand Finale,
        are invited to vote for the finalist content.
        Each voter has multiple votes but only one vote per content.
        You cannot vote multiple times for the same content.
    </p>
    <p>
        The winners of the finale are determined exclusively by the number of votes received.
        In case of a perfect tie between several finalists, the Organizing Company will look at their points from the previous challenge missions.
        The finalist who had the most points will win the allocated prize.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the number of points is similar, the finalist who responded to the different missions in the least time will win the tiebreaker.
        If there is perfect similarity in points and time, we plan a draw supervised by a bailiff to determine the winner: Maître Doniol, 7 rue Jean Jaurès- 77410 Claye Souilly

    <p class="article-label">9.2 Grand Finale</p>
    <p>
        The final ranking of winners is based primarily on the number of votes received during the final phase.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The cumulative points obtained during the previous phases will be examined, designating as the winner the participant who demonstrated the best overall performance.</li>
        <li>If the tie persists, the time factor will come into play: the participant who completed all the missions with the greatest speed will win the advantage.</li>
        <li>In the exceptional event of a perfect equality in both points and completion time, a draw supervised by a bailiff will determine the final winner.</li>
    </ul>
