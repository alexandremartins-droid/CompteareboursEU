<!-- ARTICLE 8 -->
<div id="art8" class="section-title">Article 8: Challenge Journey</div>
<div class="article-card">
    <p>The challenge journey is divided into four progressive phases, each designed to develop participants' knowledge and skills around STELLANTIS connected services:</p>

    <p class="article-label">8.1 Educational Phase (THE ACADEMY)</p>
    <p>This first fundamental mission takes place in three distinct sessions, each lasting between 10 and 15 minutes. It aims to build a solid foundation of knowledge about connected services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>#1: Discovery of STELLANTIS connected services fundamentals via the Drive Smarter session</li>
        <li>#2: Discovery of STELLANTIS connected services fundamentals via the Life Easier session</li>
        <li>#3: Discovery of STELLANTIS connected services fundamentals via the Trip Enjoyable session</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="article-label">8.2 Practical Phase (THE PRACTICE)</p>
    <p>
        In this second phase, the participant is placed in a simulation of a long-distance logistics journey, presented as an interactive course.
        At different stages of the virtual journey, the participant is confronted with situations requiring decision-making that will determine the participant's subsequent journey.
        For each situation, several response options are offered to the participant. No answer is considered incorrect, but some choices may be more efficient than others in terms of time, resources, or journey optimization.
    </p>

    <p class="article-label">8.3 Prospective Brainstorming Phase (THE LABORATORY)</p>
    <p>
        This third phase is a creative test aimed at imagining the connected services of the future.
        The participant is invited to answer an open question about potential innovations in the field of connected logistics services.
        The response must be formulated in text form in the dedicated space, in English, and without character limit.
    </p>
    <p>Each of these three sessions allows participants to accumulate essential points for qualification to the final phase, while consolidating their expertise and knowledge.</p>

    <p class="article-label">8.4 Finale (THE BIG FINALE)</p>
    <p>
        The grand finale consists of creating original content showcasing and highlighting one or more connected services, from an internal communication perspective.
        Finalists can submit their creation in one of the following formats:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Video content (maximum duration: 2 minutes)</li>
        <li>Audio content (maximum duration: 3 minutes)</li>
        <li>Detailed scenario (Word, PDF)</li>
        <li>Visual or infographic (JPG, PNG, PDF)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Only employees who have obtained the highest number of points at the end of the weekly challenges are qualified to participate in the grand finale, according to the following regional distribution:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Top 200 in Europe</li>
        <li>Top 100 in North America</li>
        <li>Top 35 in South America</li>
        <li>Top 35 in the IAP/China area</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        At the end of the creation period, all challenge participants, whether or not they participated in the Grand Finale, are invited to vote for the finalist content. Each voter has multiple votes but only one vote per content.
        The winners of the finale are determined exclusively by the number of votes received. In case of a perfect tie between several finalists, previous points and then completion time will be used as tie-breakers; if still tied, a draw under bailiff control will determine the winner.

<div id="art9" class="section-title">Article 9: Point System</div>
<div class="article-card">
    <p class="article-label">9.1 Basic rules</p>
    <p><b>MISSION #1</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mandatory and sometimes multiple answers</li>
        <li>Minimum score: 0 (no negative score, it remains at 0)</li>
        <li>Correct answer: 1 point added</li>
        <li>Incorrect answer: 1 point deducted</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bonus: this challenge will be timed, and the fastest participants will earn higher places in the overall regional rankings.</p>

    <p><b>MISSION #2</b></p>
    <p>A score is awarded based on the effectiveness of the choices made (from 1 to 3 points at each stage).</p>

    <p><b>MISSION #3</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Answer provided: 1 point added</li>
        <li>Answer not provided: 1 point deducted</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>GRAND FINALE</b></p>
    <p>
        The final ranking of winners is based primarily on the number of votes received during the final phase.
        In case of a perfect tie between several finalists, the cumulative points obtained during the previous phases will be examined, designating as the winner the participant who demonstrated the best overall performance.
        If the tie persists, the time factor will come into play. If still identical, a draw supervised by a bailiff will determine the winner.
    </p>

    <p class="article-label">9.3 Rankings</p>
    <p>
        At each stage, a ranking by region and country will be available, as well as the ranking of the connected person.
        The ranking is done by first name + 1st letter of the last name.
